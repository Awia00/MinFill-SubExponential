*Submitted by Anders Wind (awis@itu.dk) and Mikael Lindemann (mlin@itu.dk)*

The public repository for the submission of the <a href="https://pacechallenge.wordpress.com/pace-2017/track-b-minimum-fill-in/">PACE challenge 2017 B-Track: Minimum Fill-In </a>. The core algorithm is based on Fomin and Villanger's article <a href="http://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/11085390X">Subexponential Parameterized Algorithm for Minimum Fill-in</a>, with a few adjustments for optimization.
