# Minimum Fill-In, Sub Exponentially
*Submitted by Anders Wind (awis@itu.dk) and Mikael Lindemann (mlin@itu.dk)*

The public repository for the submission of the PACE challenge 2017 B-Track: Minimum Fill-In. The core algorithm is based on Fomin and Villanger's article "Subexponential Parameterized Algorithm for Minimum Fill-In", with a few adjustments for optimization.

A report describing the solution will be added soon.
